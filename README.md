## üî¨ About Me  
I'm a systems-oriented engineer and scientific thinker building advanced technologies across medical imaging, AI, education, and scientific collaboration. I specialize in developing **ray-based computed tomography (RBYRCT)**, leading AI teams, and architecting full-stack tools that power both deep science and accessible learning.

I operate at the convergence of:
- üß† **Neurodivergent insight**: Diagnosed with autism, I‚Äôve reframed cognition as architecture - driving focus, clarity, and complexity.  
- üîç **Deep tech R&D**: Patents, peer-reviewed publications, and open-source frameworks for imaging, simulation, and learning tools.  
- üíº **Founder energy**: As co-founder of **Janus Sphere Innovations**, I lead R&D for programmable imaging systems that aim to revolutionize early-stage cancer detection and more.
