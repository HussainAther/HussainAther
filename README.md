## 🔬 About Me  
I'm a systems-oriented engineer and scientific thinker building advanced technologies across medical imaging, AI, and educational platforms. I specialize in developing **ray-based computed tomography (RBYRCT)** and deep learning models that intersect with neuroscience, quantum physics, and human-centered design.

I operate at the convergence of:
- 🧠 **Neurodivergent insight**: Diagnosed with autism, I’ve reframed cognition as architecture — driving focus, clarity, and complexity.  
- 🔍 **Deep tech R&D**: Patents, peer-reviewed publications, and open-source frameworks for precision imaging and explainable AI.  
- 💼 **Founder energy**: As co-founder of **Janus Sphere Innovations**, I lead innovation in low-dose X-ray beam steering to revolutionize cancer detection.
